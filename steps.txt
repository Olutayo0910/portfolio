// set up
1. install django, pillow
2. django-admin startproject
3. cd to project then python3 manage.py startapp main to
create the main app


// Link the main appliction to django project
1. Go to settings in the django project i.e the one set up with 'django-admin startproject'
2. Import os, add the name of the app in INSTAlled apps 'main in this case'
3. scroll to buttom and set media for images: 
    MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
        Purpose: Defines the base URL that serves media files uploaded by users.
        Usage: When a user uploads a file, Django will make it accessible via this URL prefix. For example, if a user uploads a file called image.jpg, it will be accessible at http://yourdomain.com/media/image.jpg.
        Context: This setting is used primarily in templates to reference media files, e.g., {{ MEDIA_URL }}my_image.jpg.
    MEDIA_ROOT = OS.PATH.JOIN(BASE_DIR, "media")
        Purpose: Specifies the filesystem path where media files are stored.
        Usage: When a user uploads a file, Django will save it in this directory. For example, if the project is located at /home/user/myproject/ and a file is uploaded, it will be saved to /home/user/myproject/media/.
        BASE_DIR: This is a variable typically defined in the settings.py file that points to the base directory of your project.
        os.path.join: This function is used to construct a full filesystem path by joining the base directory with the media subdirectory. This ensures that the path is constructed correctly regardless of the operating system.


// create database models for storing projects
    1. Go to models.py in main and create the models

// create the media directory in the portfolio directory
    - The reason is we already specify the media in the settings.py as 
    where we will store our images
    - wathever part we set for the image in our model would be AUTOMATICALLY CREATED

// register your modules in admin.py

// makemigrations and migrate
    N>B migration files create, db.sqlite created

// createsuperuser

// python3 manage.py runserver

// create your static and templates folder in your project 'main'

// create urls.py, import views from . and include urlpatterns =[]

// create your views in views.py

// link your views to django.urls AND IMPORT STATIC AND settings
